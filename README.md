## Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of a dataset provided by Zomato, a popular restaurant discovery and food delivery service. The goal is to extract meaningful insights about restaurant ratings, types, and distribution across different regions, which can help restaurant owners and marketers enhance their service offerings and improve customer satisfaction.

   - Cleaned and standardized the data in the 'Rating', 'Price', 'Reviews', and 'Region' columns

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   - Grouped ratings into three categories: Low, Medium, and High
   - Plotted graphs to visualize the percentage of restaurants as per ratings

3. **Insights Extraction**
   - Identified the top 10 types of outlets and plotted the distribution
   - Explored the different types of cuisines served and identified the top 5 cuisines
   - Calculated the percentage of restaurants serving the top 5 cuisines
   - Analyzed the distribution of restaurant reviews
   - Identified the top 10 regions with the most number of restaurants and plotted the distribution
